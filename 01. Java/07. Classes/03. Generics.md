### Generics in Java

Generics in Java, introduced in **Java 5**, are a way to **parameterize types**. This means that you can write classes, interfaces, and methods that operate on objects of **different types** while providing compile-time type safety. Generics allow you to create **reusable** code that can work with any type, while still ensuring that you don’t make type-related errors.

The key benefits of generics are:
1. **Type Safety**: With generics, the compiler checks the type of objects you’re working with at compile time, reducing errors at runtime.
2. **Code Reusability**: You can write a single method or class to handle different types, improving code flexibility and reducing duplication.
3. **Elimination of Casts**: When using generics, there’s no need for explicit type casts, which can lead to errors and reduce readability.

### 1. **Generics with Collections**

The most common use of generics is with Java’s **collection framework** (e.g., `List`, `Map`, `Set`). By using generics, you can specify the types of elements a collection can store. This provides type safety by ensuring that only objects of the specified type can be added to the collection.

#### Example:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("John");  // This works fine
// names.add(100);   // Compile-time error: cannot add Integer to List<String>
String name = names.get(0);  // No cast needed, as we know it's a String
```

In this case, `List<String>` tells the compiler that the list will only hold `String` objects. You don't need to cast the result when you retrieve elements, because the list is type-safe.

### 2. **Generic Classes**

A **generic class** is a class that can work with any type, and the type is specified when an object of that class is created.

#### Example:

```java
public class Box<T> {
    private T value;

    public T getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public void setValue(T value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
}
```

- `T` is a **type parameter**. It can represent any type.
- When creating an object of the `Box` class, you can specify the type (e.g., `Box<String>`, `Box<Integer>`).

#### Using the Generic Class:

```java
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
stringBox.setValue("Hello");
String str = stringBox.getValue();  // No cast needed

Box<Integer> intBox = new Box<>();
intBox.setValue(123);
Integer num = intBox.getValue();  // No cast needed
```

Here, `Box<T>` is a generic class. When you create an object of the class, you specify the actual type for `T`, such as `String` or `Integer`.

### 3. **Generic Methods**

You can also have **generic methods** within classes. A generic method allows you to specify the type when you call the method, even if the class itself is not a generic class.

#### Example:

```java
public class Utils {
    // A generic method
    public static <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
        for (T element : array) {
            System.out.println(element);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:
- `<T>` declares a **type parameter** for the method `printArray`.
- When you call `printArray`, you specify the type of `T` based on the type of the array.

#### Using the Generic Method:

```java
String[] strArray = {"Hello", "World"};
Integer[] intArray = {1, 2, 3};

Utils.printArray(strArray);  // Prints "Hello" "World"
Utils.printArray(intArray);  // Prints 1 2 3
```

In this case, `printArray` works for both `String[]` and `Integer[]` because of the generic method.

### 4. **Bounded Type Parameters**

Sometimes you might want to restrict the types that can be used as arguments for a generic type. This is done using **bounded type parameters**. You can specify that a type parameter extends a specific class or implements an interface.

#### Upper-Bounded Wildcards (`extends`):

An **upper-bounded wildcard** allows you to specify that a type must be a subtype of a certain class or implement a specific interface.

Example: `List<? extends Number>` means the list can hold `Number` or any subclass of `Number` (like `Integer`, `Double`, `Float`, etc.).

```java
public static void printNumbers(List<? extends Number> list) {
    for (Number num : list) {
        System.out.println(num);
    }
}
```

This method can accept a `List<Integer>`, `List<Double>`, `List<Float>`, etc., because all these types extend `Number`.

#### Lower-Bounded Wildcards (`super`):

A **lower-bounded wildcard** allows you to specify that a type must be a supertype of a specific class.

Example: `List<? super Integer>` means the list can hold `Integer` or any superclass of `Integer` (like `Number`, `Object`).

```java
public static void addNumbers(List<? super Integer> list) {
    list.add(10);  // Works because Integer is a subtype of Number
    // list.add(10.5); // Error: Cannot add Double to List<? super Integer>
}
```

This method can accept a `List<Integer>`, `List<Number>`, or `List<Object>`.

### 5. **Wildcard Types**

A **wildcard** (`?`) is a special placeholder for an unknown type. You use wildcards when you don't care about the specific type, but you still want to ensure some level of type safety.

#### Example of Wildcard Use:

```java
// A List of any type of object
List<?> list = new ArrayList<String>();
```

- `?` is a **unbounded wildcard** that can represent any type. It is often used when you want to read from a collection but don’t need to modify it (i.e., add elements).

### 6. **Generic Interfaces**

You can also define **generic interfaces**. A generic interface works similarly to a generic class but can be implemented by different types of classes.

#### Example:

```java
interface Pair<K, V> {
    K getKey();
    V getValue();
}

class SimplePair<K, V> implements Pair<K, V> {
    private K key;
    private V value;

    public SimplePair(K key, V value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }

    public K getKey() {
        return key;
    }

    public V getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

#### Using the Generic Interface:

```java
Pair<String, Integer> pair = new SimplePair<>("Age", 30);
String key = pair.getKey();  // String
Integer value = pair.getValue();  // Integer
```

Here, `Pair<K, V>` is a generic interface, and `SimplePair<K, V>` is a class that implements the generic interface with specific types.

### 7. **Generic Type Erasure**

Java implements generics through **type erasure**. This means that at **runtime**, the generic type information is **removed** and replaced with **raw types** (e.g., `Object`). For example, `List<String>` and `List<Integer>` are both treated as `List` at runtime.

- **At compile-time**: Generics are fully supported, and type checks are done to ensure type safety.
- **At runtime**: The type information is erased. For instance, `List<String>` becomes just a `List`.

This is why you cannot use `instanceof` to check the type of a generic class at runtime, and why you cannot create an array of a generic type.

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
// The type information of String is erased at runtime.
```

### 8. **Why Use Generics?**

- **Type Safety**: Generics provide compile-time checks that prevent type errors, reducing bugs.
- **Code Reusability**: You can write code that works with any object type, without needing to write multiple versions of the same code for different types.
- **Eliminate Casting**: With generics, you don’t need to cast objects from a collection, which eliminates the risk of `ClassCastException` at runtime.

### Conclusion

Generics are a powerful feature of Java that allow you to write more flexible, reusable, and type-safe code. By using generics, you can create classes, methods, and interfaces that work with any type while ensuring type safety and avoiding runtime errors related to type mismatches.

- **Generic classes** let you define reusable classes for different types.
- **Generic methods** provide flexibility for defining methods that work with different types.
- **Wildcards** allow you to define more flexible and general types for collections.
- **Bounded type parameters** enable you to limit the types that can be used as arguments to a generic class or method.

Generics make your Java code more robust, flexible, and maintainable by enabling the development of **type-safe collections** and **algorithms**.
